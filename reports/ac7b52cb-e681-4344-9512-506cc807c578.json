These Services will be provided with the incentives (\"Incentives\") as also set forth below. These Incentives shall only be available to the locations and account numbers approved and identified in Addendum A. Account numbers of Customer and its affiliates, each of which is more than fifty percent (50.0%) owned by Customer, may be added or deleted only by mutual written agreement of Customer and UPS and require seven (7) business days notice to UPS to become effective. Customer is prohibited from reselling or offering Incentives to any other party without the prior written consent of UPS and failure to comply with this prohibition may result in immediate cancellation of this Agreement.\n\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that the Incentives and the minimum rates in Addendum B are based on and derived from the most recently published UPS Daily Rates available at www.ups.com and are subject to change based on changes to such list rates. Each eligible package (or shipment) will receive its applicable Incentive for the term of this Agreement. Incentives are applied on a weekly basis unless otherwise specified. Incentives shall be applied to prepaid outbound shipments unless otherwise noted. This Agreement will be subject to periodic review by UPS for Customer compliance.\n\nAutomation. Customer agrees to supply the UPS Service Provider with a hard copy summary manifest at the time that the packages are tendered to UPS for shipment and provide UPS with Timely Upload of electronic Package Level Detail (\"PLD\") in a form acceptable to UPS. PLD includes, but is not limited to, consignee's full name, complete delivery address, package weight and zone. Timely Upload is defined as the electronic transmission of PLD to UPS at the time the packages are tendered to UPS. Customer agrees to provide smart labels on all packages tendered to UPS. A smart label, as defined herein and described in the current UPS Guide to Labeling, which may be updated from time to time by UPS, includes, but is not limited to, a MaxiCode, Postal Bar Code, current UPS Routing Code, appropriate UPS Service Icon and a UPS 1Z Tracking Number Bar Code. Customer further agrees that all shipping locations will use a UPS OnLine or OnLine compatible shipping solution that is approved and authorized by UPS as such.\n\n<u>Custom Payment Terms.</u> Customer agrees to pay for all shipments in full within the time period required by UPS. Refer to Addendum A for payment terms applicable to specified accounts for this agreement. Where included these payment terms supersede any previous payment terms for the specified accounts and represent the number of days from the time the invoice is generated until payment is due. Payment terms contained within this agreement will be applicable for the period in which accounts are part of this agreement after which accounts will revert to the payment terms contained in the UPS Rate and Service Guide and UPS Tarift/Terms and Conditions of Service.\n\n<u>Service</u>, All Services provided by UPS shall be pursuant to the UPS Rate and Service Guide and UPS Tariff/Terms and Conditions of Service in effect at the time of shipping, each of which are incorporated herein by reference and which may be subject to change without prior notice and which, together with this Agreement, are the entire agreement and understanding between Customer and UPS relating to the relationship under this Agreement, superseding all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings.\n\nConfidentiality. Customer and UPS agree to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement including its rates, terms and incentives (\"Confidential Information\") unless disclosure is required by law. Customer agrees not to post or publicly display this Confidential Information.\n\nOffer Expiration and Prior Agreements. This offer is void if not accepted by January 20, 2017 (\"Deadline\"). Customer may accept Agreement by providing a duly signed copy of this Agreement to UPS by the Deadline. This Agreement supersedes all other agreements between the Customer and UPS regarding these Services. This Agreement is hereby signed and executed by authorized representatives of both parties.\n\nTerm. The Incentives contained in this Agreement take effect on the Monday following the signing of this Agreement or the Effective Date, whichever is later and continue until terminated by either party. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to the other.\n\n| UPS                                         | Customer            | 1                              |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| United Percel Service Int.
