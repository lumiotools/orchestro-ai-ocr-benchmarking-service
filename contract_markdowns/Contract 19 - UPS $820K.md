**Pricing.** UPS will provide the pickup and delivery services ("Services") as set forth below subject to the terms of this Agreement. These Services will be provided with the incentives ("Incentives") as also set forth below. These Incentives shall only be available to the locations and account numbers approved and identified in Addendum A. Account numbers of Customer and its affiliates, each of which is more than fifty percent (50.0%) owned by Customer, may be added or deleted only by mutual written agreement of Customer and UPS and require seven (7) business days notice to UPS to become effective. Customer is prohibited from reselling or offering Incentives to any other party without the prior written consent of UPS and failure to comply with this prohibition may result in immediate cancellation of this Agreement.  
  
Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Incentives and the minimum rates in Addendum B are based on and derived from the most recently published UPS Daily Rates available at www.ups.com and are subject to change based on changes to such list rates. Each eligible package (or shipment) and accessorial will receive its applicable Incentive for the term of this Agreement. Incentives are applied on a weekly basis unless otherwise specified. Incentives shall be applied to prepaid outbound shipments unless otherwise noted. This Agreement will be subject to periodic review by UPS for Customer compliance.  
  
**Automation.** Customer agrees to supply the UPS Service Provider with a hard copy summary manifest at the time that the packages are tendered to UPS for shipment and provide UPS with Timely Upload of electronic Package Level Detail ("PLD") in a form acceptable to UPS. PLD includes, but is not limited to, consignee's full name, complete delivery address, package weight and zone. Timely Upload is defined as the electronic transmission of PLD to UPS at the time the packages are tendered to UPS. Customer agrees to provide smart labels on all packages tendered to UPS.

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to the other. In addition to these termination rights, UPS shall have the right to terminate the UPS SurePost Service Incentive Program set forth herein immediately (i) if Customer fails to comply with any term of the UPS SurePost , or (ii) if the US Postal Service eliminates or changes the terms under which it provides the Lightweight Parcel Select Service for packages tendered pursuant to UPS SurePost.
