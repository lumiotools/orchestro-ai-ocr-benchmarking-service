# GROUND PRICING ATTACHMENT APPENDIX  
  
**Ground Multiweight Program Details**  
  
**Multiweight.** The base rates as published in the FedEx Service Guide in effect on the date of shipment, and as modified by any other addenda for ground services between FedEx and Customer, will be superseded by the Customer's Multiweight rates, as defined in the table(s) above, provided that the Customer's Multiweight rates result in lower package charges to the Customer. Multiweight rates do not apply to special handling fees, surcharges, ancillary or other charges unless expressly stated otherwise.  
  
FedEx reserves the right to change the Multiweight Service Rate Charge at any time.  
  
Multiweight service is applicable for aggregations of package shipments that are greater than or equal to the minimum shipment weight shown in the table(s) above. In determining total shipment weight and average package weight, each package in the aggregation of packages is weighed and its individual weight is then rounded up to the next full pound. All oversized and dimensional package weight rules apply. For outbound prepaid packages, an aggregation is defined as packages shipped to a single customer at the same address on the same day under one Customer account number and from a single pick-up location. For international shipments, an aggregation is defined as packages shipped under the same shipment number shipped to a single Consignee facility on the same day under one Customer account number. For inbound collect packages, an aggregation is defined as packages shipped under one Customer account number on the same day to the Consignee facility under the same Consignee number.  
  
The Multiweight charge shall be determined by multiplying the current rate per hundred pounds for the zone applicable to the shipment by the number of Multiweight units. Multiweight units are determined by taking the greater of total rated shipment weight or the minimum average package weight shown in the table(s) above times the number of packages in the aggregation and dividing by 100.DRAFTDRAFTProposal : 241146314/15Agreement Number: 595214768-101-02
